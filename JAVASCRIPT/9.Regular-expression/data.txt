Rules of regular expressions

1. /expression/ if regular expression as string

2. /^condition$/ if regular expression is condition
    ^ -> defines the beginning tag of regular expression statement
    $ -> defines the ending tag

3. [] -> character set (Grouping)
    example:
        [abcdef] -> input should match atleast single occurence of any of the given characters
        [a-z] lowercase or [A-Z] uppercase or [0-9] decimal
        [a-zA-Z] or [a-z0-9] or [A-Z0-9] or [a-zA-Z0-9]
        [D-S]

4. () -> capturing group of multiple characters

5. operators
    . = matches any character except line break /n
    ? = matches 0 & 1 occurence of the preceding char, set or group
    * = matches 0 or more occurence
    + = matches 1 and more occurence
    {n} -> matches exactly n and m occurence
    {n,m} -> matches exactly n and m occurence
    g -> global 
    gi => global case insensitive
    u => unicode (consider pattern strings are UTF-16) 
    y => sticky
